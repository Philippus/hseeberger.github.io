**Update**: Thanks to feedback from [@kai_nyasha](https://twitter.com/kai_nyasha) and [@loic_d](https://twitter.com/loic_d) I have removed the now unnecessary separate type class syntax stuff.

Type classes are implemented as a three-part pattern in Scala 2: we use a polymorphic trait with one or more abstract methods for the type class and different applications of the `implicit` keyword to provide the type class syntax and the type class instances:

``` scala
// The type class is a polymorphic trait
trait SemiGroup[A] {
  def combine(a1: A, a2: A): A
}

// The type class syntax is provided by extension methods
// with an implicit parameter for the type class
final implicit class SemiGroupSyntax[A](val lhs: A) extends AnyVal {
  final def |+| (rhs: A)(implicit sga: SemiGroup[A]): A =
    lhs.combine(rhs)

  def combine(rhs: A)(implicit sga: SemiGroup[A]): A =
    sga.combine(lhs, rhs)
}

// The type class instance is an implicit value
// implementing the type class
final implicit val intSemiGroup: SemiGroup[Int] =
  _ + _
```

In Scala 3 the approach is simplified: all we need are extension methods which we covered in the [previous blog post](/2019/12/04/2019-12-04-dotty-2) and the new *given instances*.

## Type Classes

As in Scala 2 type classes are polymorphic traits with one or more abstract methods. Yet instead of "normal" methods we already provide the syntax via extension methods. Then every type, which has a given instance (see below) of the type class in scope, acquires the extension methods.

To define a semigroup type class we use the new experimental brace-less syntax, which might or might not make it into Scala 3:

``` scala
package lmss

trait SemiGroup[A]:

  extension (lhs: A)
    def combine(rhs: A): A

    final def |+|(rhs: A): A =
      lhs.combine(rhs)
```

## Given Instances

To provide type class instances we use given instances, which can be anonymous, implementing the abstract type class methods:

``` scala
package lmss
package instances
package semigroup

given SemiGroup[Int]:
  extension (lhs: Int)
    override def combine(rhs: Int): Int =
      lhs + rhs

given [A] as SemiGroup[Seq[A]]:
  extension  (lhs: Seq[A])
    override def combine(rhs: Seq[A]): Seq[A] =
      lhs ++ rhs
```

## Given Imports

Unless the respective given instances are already in scope, e.g. locally or via inheritance, they have to be imported. Other than in Scala 2 we cannot use a standard import clause, but instead we have to use the new *given imports*:

``` scala
scala> import lmss.instances.semigroup.{ given _ }

scala> 42 |+| 7
val res0: Int = 49
```

The above imports all given instances from the `semigroup` package. We can also select specific types to be imported:

``` scala
scala> import lmss.instances.semigroup.{ given lmss.SemiGroup[?] }
```

## Conclusion

Compared to Scala 2 type classes are easier and more straightforward to implement in Scala 3: no more implicit classes for the syntax needed, just the type class as a polymorphic trait with extension methods and type class instances as given instances.
