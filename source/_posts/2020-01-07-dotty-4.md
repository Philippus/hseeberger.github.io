In Scala 2 – like in Java – we have universal equality which means that we can compare two objects – each of any type – for equality:

``` scala
scala> final case class Foo()

scala> Foo() == Foo()
val res0: Boolean = true

scala> Foo() == Option(Foo()) // Pointless!
val res1: Boolean = false
```

As shown above, universal equality can lead to pointless equality comparisons. The reason for this unfortunate behavior is the `equals` method, which is defined for every class – either inherited from `Any` or overwritten – and has a parameter of type `Any`:

``` scala
def equals(other: Any): Boolean
```

Scala 3 adds the `strictEquality` language feature which only allows using `==` and its counterpart `!=` in the presence of a given `Eql` instance:

``` scala
scala> import scala.language.strictEquality

scala> Foo() == Foo() // Does not compile yet ...
1 |Foo() == Foo()
  |^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
  |Values of types Foo and Foo cannot be compared with == or !=

scala> given Eql[Foo, Foo] = Eql.derived
def given_Eql_Foo_Foo: Eql[Foo, Foo]

scala> Foo() == Foo() // ... now it compiles ;-)
val res2: Boolean = true

scala> Foo() == Option(Foo()) // Still does not compile, which is what we want!
1 |Foo() == Option(Foo())
  |^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
  |Values of types Foo and Option[Foo] cannot be compared with == or !=
```

As we can see above, after activating strict equality – also called multiversal equality – we can no longer compare two `Foo` instances for equality. After providing a given `Eql[Foo, Foo]` instance this becomes possible, but we still cannot perform the pointless comparison of `Foo()` and `Option(Foo())`, which is exactly what we want in most cases (see below).

Instead of "manually" providing given `Eql[A, A]` instances to compare certain types `A` with themselves for equality, we can simply derive them:

``` scala
scala> final case class Bar() derives Eql

scala> Bar() == Bar()
val res3: Boolean = true
```

It is worth noting, that `Eql` is not used at runtime – the actual equality comparison is still carried out through calling good old `equals`.

Also noteworthy, we can still compare objects of different type for equality. All we need to do is provide the necessary given `Eql` instances – we need two, one for each "direction":

``` scala
scala> given Eql[Foo, Bar] = Eql.derived
def given_Eql_Foo_Bar: Eql[Foo, Bar]

scala> given Eql[Bar, Foo] = Eql.derived
def given_Eql_Bar_Foo: Eql[Bar, Foo]

scala> Foo() == Bar()
val res4: Boolean = false

scala> Bar() == Foo()
val res5: Boolean = false
```

The Scala standard library provides some of these bidirectional `Eql` instances for numeric types:

``` scala
scala> 1L == 1
val res6: Boolean = true

scala> 1 == 1.0
val res7: Boolean = true
```

If backwards compatibility is needed, we simply not use the `strictEquality` language feature. This leads to the compiler providing the needed given `Eql` instance – if necessary – by using the `eqlAny` method, which itself is not defined as given:

``` scala
def eqlAny[L, R]: Eql[L, R] = Eql.derived
```
