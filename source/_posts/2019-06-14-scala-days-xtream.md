Scala Days 2019 and its sister conference Typelevel Summit were incredibly inspiring and I am traveling home with a lot of motivation in my backpack and elsewhere. I gave a talk about "Scala Streams to the Extreme" and you can find the source code for the demo at [github.com/hseeberger/xtream](https://github.com/hseeberger/xtream) and the slides at [github.com/hseeberger/deck-xtream](https://github.com/hseeberger/deck-xtream).
