Like every year Scala eXchange London 2018 has been a blast again. I met friends, attended a lot of really interesting and inspiring talks and missed quite a few. Luckily the videos of the talks are already avaliable â€“ here is the link to my talk about "Akka Cluster up and running": https://skillsmatter.com/skillscasts/12671-akka-cluster-up-and-running. The source code of the demo application can be found at https://github.com/hseeberger/akkluster.
